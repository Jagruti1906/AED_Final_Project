Project Background:
We have made a township management system, using which the resident can avail and manage their basic utilities such as add gas or electricity connection, send alerts for emergencies such as fire, crime (FIR), book a tour for nearby schools and so on. 
The system admin can create different users such as Fire department admin, Police department admin, School department admin, Hospital department admin who all manage their own respective departments.

For example -:
In case of a Fire emergency the user will send a request to the fire department, for now the status of the request will remain pending for the user, the fire department admin will get the request in the fire alerts, and they can view it and update the status to approved.
Once approved the status on the user screen will reflect approved too.
